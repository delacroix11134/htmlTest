		<h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
		<p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of raw coffee beans into roasted coffee products. This process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Many coffee roasters determine the level of roast by eye, assessing the color of the beans to determine the desired roast-level.</p>

			<p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>
